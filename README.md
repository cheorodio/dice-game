<h2> Gameplay: </h2>
A player rolls the die as many times as they wish. Each result will get added to their ‘current score’ board however if the player rolls a 1, the current score will get lost and it’s the next player’s turn. The player can choose to save their current score by hitting the ‘hold’ button which will then get transferred to their global score, then it’s the next player’s turn. The game ends when a player reaches a total global score of 100.

<h2>Reflection 💭</h2>
I learnt this from <a href="https://codingheroes.io/"> Jonas Schmedtmann</a>. 
This was my second JavaScript project and it was a lot of fun to make. The original project didn't have the extra features, but I wanted to incorporate all the techniques that I have learnt so far and so this project have the added features mentioned above.
<h4> What challenged me the most: </h4>
When I decided that I wanted to add the message to let the players know that they rolled a 1, I knew it was going to be a challenge. I spent a few hours trying to figure it out but I'm super happy that I managed to do so! It felt such an achievement having to figure this out by myself!! 🥳
